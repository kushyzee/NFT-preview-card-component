## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had a tough time figuring out how to overlay the cyan color over the equilibrum.jpeg image and I also had to add the icon-view.svg image on the overlayed cyan color which had to show up when a mouse hovers over it, but luckily i learnt how to do it from w3schools website

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay_icon.asp) - They have been a tremendous help in helping me figure out how to overlay an icon over an image
